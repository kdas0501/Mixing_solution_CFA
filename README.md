# Mixing_solution_CFA
This repository contains working code for pricing European put options with piecewise-constant parameters in the Heston model and GARCH diffusion model (GARCH diffusion model rho = 0 a.e..) using the closed-form approximation formulas from the article 'Closed-form approximations with respect to the mixing solution for option pricing under stochastic volatility'.
